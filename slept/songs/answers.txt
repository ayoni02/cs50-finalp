If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would say they have a huge penchanct for loud hip music

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I used the average loudness, energy, tempo to calculate the above. There is a chance that the listener is just more interested in popular songs and hence isn't up with my calculated scale
